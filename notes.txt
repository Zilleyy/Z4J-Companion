Ionic Notes:

- Components vs Pages
    - Ionic pages are different from components. Components are ONLY meant to be part of a page unlike angular where a component can act as a full on page.
    - Each page essentially acts as it's own module. SO if you want to import another component or package into a specific page, dont forget to import it through the page.module.ts file.
    - For example, the explore-container component in this app is a good example of how a component should be used. It is just a section of the Tab pages.
    - To create a new page, use command ionic g page path/to/name-of-page.

-Tabs
    - Tabs can be set through the tabs module under src/app/tabs
    - tabs-routing.module.ts defines the path to each page. 
    - tabs.page.html defines the layout for the bottom tabs.
    - View tabs-routing.module.ts line 11 and tabs.page.html line 4 for insightful comment on how tabs routing works.
    - If you want to add a new page to the tab list, use the same declaration as the other 3 tabs to import it into the tab list and add it to your HTML. 
        - See tabs.page.html line 19 and tabs-routing.module line 22 for example.
